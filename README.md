# Getting Started with Create Ballot App

## What is 'Njangi'?

'Njangi' is a Cameroonian term for an institutional practice whereby individuals decide to come together usually to form a group that meets on a regular basis for the purpose of saving and/or raising money for the mutual benefit of all participants. These participants go through a ballot system to decide the order in which the members will benefit. This used to be a practice among the elderly where they will meet weekly to make contributions but ever since MTN Mobile Money and Orange Money surfaced, young people have embraced the concept of 'Njangi'. Most 'Njangi' groups among young people do not require a physical gathering, they make contributions through e-wallet systems to the admin who then transfers the money to the beneficiary.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
